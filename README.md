Shell Help
==========

Doing things in the terminal has a steep learning curve, so this repo is meant to compile some helpful information for my classmates in CS 100 (or anyone else).

This resource is meant to be collaborative. If you think that something is missing or incorrect, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/eshimoniak-ucr/shell-help/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/eshimoniak-ucr/shell-help/pulls) about it.

I've tried to split things out into multiple files and categories to keep it organized.
